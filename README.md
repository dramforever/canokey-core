## Introduction

Core implementations of an open-source secure key, with supports of:

* U2F / FIDO2
* OpenPGP Card V3.4 with EcDSA / EdDSA / ECDH support
* PIV (NIST SP 800-73-4)
* HOTP / TOTP

The USB mode contains 3 different interfaces:

* Interface 0: U2F / FIDO2, which is an HID interface
* Interface 1: PIV/OpenPGP/OATH Card, which is a CCID interface
* Interface 2: WebUSB, which is not a standard interface
* Interface 3: Keyboard

The WebUSB interface is used to configure the key via a web-based interface.

## Protocol

Please refer to the [documentation](https://canokeys.github.io/doc/).

## Porting

Use [Canokey-STM32](https://github.com/canokeys/canokey-stm32) as an example.

1. You need to implement these functions in `device.h`:

   * `void device_delay(int ms);`
   * `uint32_t device_get_tick(void);`
   * `int device_spinlock_lock(volatile uint32_t *lock, uint32_t blocking);`
   * `void device_spinlock_unlock(volatile uint32_t *lock);`
   * `void led_on(void);`
   * `void led_off(void);`
   * `void device_set_timeout(void (*callback)(void), uint16_t timeout);`
      * A hardware timer with IRQ is required

2. You should also provide a `random32` and a optional `random_buffer` function in `rand.h`.

3. You need to configure the littlefs properly.

4. You need to configure the mbed-tls according to its documentation or provide the algorithms on your own by overwriting the weak symbols.

   Or instead, you may implement the cryptography algorithms by yourself.

5. You should call the `device_loop` in the main loop, and the `device_update_led` in a periodic interrupt. 

6. You may call the `set_touch_result` to report touch sensing result.


## Fuzz testing

Install honggfuzz from source first, then enable fuzz tests:

```bash
cd build
cmake .. -DENABLE_FUZZING=ON -DENABLE_TESTS=ON -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=hfuzz-clang -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
```

Then, run fuzzing tests:

```bash
./fuzzer/run-fuzzer.sh honggfuzz ${id}
```
